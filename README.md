# SBEditorTools
To import SBDataTable.

### about this
This repository is a plugin that sets up a menu to run a program that exports DataTables, which are .json files in the /Game/Local/Data folder, which are data management objects for Stellar Blade, to the UE4 Editor.  
It depends on the SBDataTable repository.  

Checking it out into the uproject/Plugin folder will implement SBEditorTools.
