# SBEditorTools
To import SBDataTable.

### about this
This repository is a plugin that sets up a menu to run a program that exports DataTables, which are .json files in the /Game/Local/Data folder, which are data management objects for Stellar Blade, to the UE4 Editor.  
It depends on the SBDataTable repository.  

Checking it out into the uproject/Plugin folder will implement SBEditorTools.

## Attention!!
You may encounter packing issues when compiling and running.  If so, you'll need to disable Smart App Control.  Only use this if you've already disabled it or have the ability to.
